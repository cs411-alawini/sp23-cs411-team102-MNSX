#Steam Game Recommendation Engine

## Project Summary
The Steam Game Recommendation Engine is a web application that aims to streamline the process of finding games that are very specifically similar to a game that the user has heard of or played before. The user first will select or enter a game available on the platform to use as a base for their search. The application will output similar games based on the attributes of their entered game. Alternatively, users can also find games based on the filters including (but not limited to) genre, PC compatibility, multiplayer functionality, critic ratings, age, and price. For all games suggested to the user, the application will link these games using the information in the database.
The user will be able to login using Google authentication (their email), and all recent searches and games resulting from these searches will be stored in the userâ€™s history. Lastly, the application will suggest users with the same game suggestions to encourage them to find other gamers with similar interests in games on Steam.
